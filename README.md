Relational algebra library for python
=======================================

This project is meant as an exercise and toolkit for experimentation
with relational algebra. It aims to provide methods for common
operations and implement them in a concise way with no regard taken
for performance. The library itself intended more for humans to read
than to provide anything useful in any actual software.
